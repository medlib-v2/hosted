Please note that the Hosted issue tracker is reserved for bug reports and enhancements. We are not always able to debug Vagrant, Provider or Operating System issues but will do our best to help. Thank you!

## Versions
  - Vagrant: Run `vagrant -v` to show the version.
  - Provider: Virtualbox, VMWare or Parallels and it's version.
  - Hosted: Run `hosted --version` to show the version.

**A lot of issues can be resolved by simply updating vagrant, provider or hosted.**
>**Note:** Virtualbox users, please upgrade to `~5.1`. You *will* show as up-to-date from the `~5.0` branch when you `About -> Check for Updates`. You'll need to download a newer version of [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
